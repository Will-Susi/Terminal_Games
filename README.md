# Terminal Games
Various games built from scratch in C++ that can be played through terminal IO.

## Running the Games
All games can be run using the standard linux executable command: "./game_name" where "game_name" should be replaced with any of the following games listed below.

## Changing the Games
As I will mention below, some of the code can be changed to change the game environments. To remake the games you will have to have the "g++" compiler and the "make" package. When attempting to recompile and run the program simply run the following command: "make && ./game_name".

## List of Games:
